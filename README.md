Test documentation site for the docs-as-code workflow. This repository is intended to highlight my DocOps experience, not my technical writing experience.

## Static Site Generator vs. WordPress
Static site generators have the following advantages over WordPress:
- Static site generators have static files, so they don't need to query the database to get the files. This makes them load faster which boosts the site in search engine rankings. "Typically Jekyll sites have Google LightHouse Page Speed scores of 90-100."
- Jekyll is cheaper to run and many of it's add-ons are free, unlike WordPress.
- Static sites are more secure.
- The WordPress domain name can be preserved and so can backlinks.
